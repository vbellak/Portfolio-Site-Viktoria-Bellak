            <p>In 2023 I started my journey as a UX Designer, where I can put my passion for User Research and UI Design to a practice and make exciting ideas come to live. During a 6-month part-time project I created an application specifically designed for sailors.</p> 
            <p>On this page you can find all the details of the iterative process, that created VELA - Your one in all solution for the most enjoyable sailing experience!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>What is VELA offering you?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stay safe & up to date with real-time weather notifications!</li>
                <li>Secure night spots & find points of interest for your current location!</li>
                <li>Plan your routes & meet fellow sailors around you!</li>
            </ol>       
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>How was the project conducted?</h3>
            <p>The iterative, user-centered Design Process consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
                <li>Defining Business Requirements and User Stories</li>
                <li>User research with Interviews</li>
                <li>Defining User Personas, User Journeys & User Flows</li>
                <li>Creating Sitemaps with help of Card Sorting</li>
                <li>Creating Navigation & Design Patterns</li>
                <li>Low-Fidelity Prototyping using Paper & Pen</li>
                <li>Creating Mid- and High-Fidelity prototypes using Figma</li>
                <li>Conducting Usability Testing & Preference Testing</li>
                <li>Organizing Feedback with Affinity Maps</li>
                <li>Applying UI Design to Prototypes using Material Design Guidelines</li>
                <li>Creating Design Language System(s)</li>
                <li>End-2-End Design</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My role in this project</h3>
            <p>The creation of VELA was basically a one woman show, as I did everything myself from start to finish. To learn everything about and become a great UX Designer someday, I have completed every single stage of a UX Design process to create my first real application. From conducting the competitive analysis, to creating interview guidelines, moderating interviews and processing the outcomes to sketching out with pen and paper before transferring my visions into an interactive, clicking prototype.</p>
            <p>I was always pretty strong and comfortable in the area of User Research, as my professional background is filled with Design Thinking, but all other parts I was kind of struggling with. Creating VELA and building it up in time-boxed iterations helped me keep the overview and helped me challenge my creativity and spontaneity to bring my ideas to life. It is all about starting small, but starting! Once I managed to shut my brain off and just draw out my ideas with no regard to cleanliness, colours, sizes, etc., I quickly had a load of Wireframes ready to be improved and reworked in the following iterations.</p>
            <p>The journey has been definitely a wild one with many challenges, but even more learnings, which helped me grow more confident in my abilities regarding Design. It is an amazing feeling, to see your visions turn to reality and gain experience and feedback to keep improving! This project was just the start of a hopefully amazing journey in the world of User Experience Design.</p>
            <p>Let's have a look at the creation process for VELA down below.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>To define WHAT I want to create, I started with a problem hypothesis and potential solutions</h3>
            <p>Spending time on a boat is one of the most relaxing and fun activities one can enjoy. But spontaneous weather changes, stressful maneuvres, battling for free spaces on buoys or in bays, as well as getting lost in the number of knots and theory you need to know for a safe sailing experience can quickly turn a delightful sailing trip into a nightmare. Therefore, we designed the VELA app, which is a responsive web app specifically designed for sailors, to create a satisfying sailing experience and avoid stress and dangerous situations. </p>
            <p>If done right, we will be able to create a unique user experience by offering substantial functionalities for all areas involved in sailing such as weather forecasts, route planning, reserving docking spots, alarm notifications, area information, boat charter and much more.</p>
            <p>Enabling users to use the app during an ongoing turn to look up necessary information such as weather conditions, maneuvres, or knots, book anchoring spots and restaurants on the route will create a delightful sailing experience.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>Before starting with any project-related work, I needed to check out the existing market and do a thorough competitive analysis</h3>
            <p>First of all, I downloaded plenty of sailing applications and compared them using the following three questions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What are they selling?</li>
                <li>What are they communicating through their product?</li>
                <li>What are they missing in their messaging, product, and overall offering?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Using a star ranking, I excluded four providers and continued with the remaining two: <b>Navily</b> and <b>SailExpert</b>.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>After creating a detailed competitor profile for each of those providers, I was able to draw two SWOT diagrams</h3>

            <h3>To verify my thoughts and improve the product itself, Usability Testing was conducted</h3>
            <p>Seven usability tests were carried out in person, as well as remote. All participants were able to complete the 3 tasks asked of them. All participants agreed that the prototype was easy to use according to Lewis' After-Scenario Questionnaire satisfaction metric</p>
            <p>The goal of the test was to assess the learnability for new users interacting with the VELA sailing app for the first time using the mobile version. I wanted to observe and measure if users understand the usage of the app, how they feel doing so (value) and verify the main functionalities of setting weather forecasts and alarms as well as finding night spots and point of interests via the map feature. An affinity map was used to categorize the test's findings and decide how to proceed with adapting the prototype.</p>
            <p>The majority of test participants found the app's functions very useful and the tasks overall easy to complete. Participants were able to set weather notifications, as well as find and book a table at a restaurant or a spot to spend the night at while on a sailing trip. Enabling more ways to a certain function, introducing clear category titles and adding color-coding will make the handling of the VELA app more satisfying and quicker for the users.</p>

            <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
            <p>As this was my very first UX Design project, I was able to take away many learnings during the creation of VELA.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creative research methods like affinity mapping and card sorting were a great help during the first phases of this project.</li>
                <li>Conducting interviews is a lot of fun and helps gathering useful insights, but takes a lot of time regarding preparation and evaluation of results if you're doing everything on your own without additional workforce.</li>
                <li>Starting to draft a prototype by simply using pen and paper and later on turning those drawings to an interactive, clickable prototype was an interesting process, that really showed the constant evolution of a product. It was a challenge for me, to start off without focusing on every little detail, but got easier over the course of this project.</li>
                <li>My biggest learning - even though I'm already familiar with iterative, time-boxed work - was to take one step after the other and trusting the process, without losing too much time at the beginning by getting lost in details that are not necessary at the time.  I'm looking forward to future UX Design projects, to keep improving my work and creativity.</li>
