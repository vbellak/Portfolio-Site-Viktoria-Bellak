                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <h4>Personal Information</h4>
                    <p>I'm thirty years old and currently living in the beautiful city Vienna, Austria with my fiancÃ© and soon-to be two-year-old daughter, who is consuming pretty much every minute of my free time when she's awake (I guess new parents can relate ðŸ˜Š). I like to spend much time outside gardening, taking walks and hiking and when the little lady is asleep, reading books and listening to podcasts. </p>
                    <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
                    <p>I'm a a UX Designer and SAFe Scrum Master and Project Manager.</p> 
                    <p>Right after school, I achieved a bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurship and a master's degree in project management, which was also the beginning of my love with agile work. My master thesis regarding the agile transformation at the company I was working for pathed the way for my first projects and opened my eyes to Design Thinking. Before going on maternity leave in 2022 I was doing internal and external workshops on Agile Work/Transformations as well as Design Thinking with colleagues and customers.</p> 
                    <p>I was always pretty strong and comfortable in the area of User Research, but struggled with the famous second diamond of Design Thinking where it comes to brainstorming ideas and getting creative. Creating my first UX Design projects and building them up in time-boxed iterations helped me keep the overview and challenge my creativity and spontaneity to bring my ideas to life. It is all about starting small, but starting! Once I managed to shut my brain off and just draw out my ideas with no regard to cleanliness, colours, sizes, etc., I quickly had a load of Wireframes ready to be improved and reworked in the following iterations.</p> 
                    <p>The company I'm currently working for is a big IT company, who is just starting to dig into the world of UX/UI Design. As I wanted to be a part of that wave from the beginning, I chose to extend my maternity leave with one year of educational leave to build a knowledge foundation and gather my first hands-on-experience with UX Design. Having completed two different sized Design Projects highly motivates me to help my company introduce and reinforce UX Design into our daily lives.</p>
